In order to diagnose Covid-19 patients, the analysis of chest x-rays is a possibility to explore to more easily detect positive cases. 
If classification of such data using deep learning proves effective in detecting positive cases, then this method can be used in hospitals and clinics when traditional testing cannot be done.

Data :
The dataset contains chest x-ray images for covid-19 positive cases but also x-ray images of normal and viral pneumonia. Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
